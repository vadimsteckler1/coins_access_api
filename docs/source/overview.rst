Coins.ph offers a white label e-wallet API that allows Filipino users who receive financial services offered by other Merchants to take full control and ownership of their digital assets. In addition, our wallet is reinforced with market-leading features to achieve institutional-grade security, ease-of-use, and unsurpassed performance.

Coins Access is an international financial platform with the following main capabilities:

- Account opening with comprehensive adherence to the standard KYC (Know Your Customer) processes of sharing and check-and-query.
- PHP depositing and withdrawal for all the different payment methods supported by Coins, such as InstaPay, PESONet, etc.
- Internal wallet-to-wallet transfers.
- Local live payments, such as mobile phone top-up, bill payments, etc.
- Transaction reconciliations synchronized between the Merchant and Coins with consecutive ledger updates.
Coins Access Account System
---------------------------

As illustrated in the diagram below, the Merchant’s and Coins.ph account systems and user spaces will remain completely segregated and independent. This is also applicable to the user’s KYC and account information that will not be shared between different “merchant” accounts even though it refers to the same individual.
